        <h1>Rule an Ancient City</h1>
        <p>
          Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer Medal for Best New
          Simulation Board Game. Players adopt role cards of characters from
          ancient Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage the administration of
          a city. Each role provides a different ability and strategy. However,
          one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players must be
          constantly aware of betrayal and double-cross. This card game provides
          a ton of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players and expansion
          packs available for larger parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must carefully
          choose his or her roles and the strategies can quickly change with the
          turn of a card. However the level of randomness is just right and
          cunning and resourcefulness can overcome bad luck (if given time.) I
          do not recommend this game unless there are at least 4 players; less
          than that reduces the intrigue and some of the game appeal.

        <p>
          Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is just about perfect
          and each player must carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the
          strategic possibilities are nearly endless, the game is simple to
          learn. The replay value is high and gets even better when you replace
          some of the cards with new cards available in the expansion packs.

          We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 to 6 players and
          we can strongly recommend the game. The different phases of the game
          are interesting and intriguing, from bluffing and stealing to site
          construction and planning. With the variety of cards and scenarios, no
          two games are ever quite the same. It's a great introduction to the
          world of strategic board games and role playing. <br />Rating: 5 / 5

        <h1>An Incredible Game</h1>
        <p>
          The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent and one of the
          best around. As for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there
          are tough decisions to make every turn. It's not only important to
          select the character that increases your chances for scoring, but also
          to anticipate the characters the opponents are likely to select, and
          then hedge against their availability. This causes a lot of
          unpredictability and deep strategic thinking. However, it can still be
          played at a more basic level for younger users. We had a lot of fun
          with this game and rate it as Best in its Class. Highly recommended.
