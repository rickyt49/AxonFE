          <p>
            Go to our online form where you can enter your registration
            information. Remember that the registration desk is closed the night
            before the event.

          <h2 id="faq2">
            What is the minimum fund-raising total I have to raise?
          </h2>
          <p>
            There is no minimum sponsorship target. Any total will help in the
            cause. Just try and raise as much as you can.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="faq3">When will my registration pack arrive?</h2>
          <p>
            We will mail out your registration pack in the post within two weeks
            of your registration. If you have not received the pack within that
            time, please contact us.
          </p>
        </li>

          <h2 id="faq4">What does it cost to register?</h2>
          <p>$35 for the 5K/10K race. The 1-Mile Fun Runs are free.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="faq5">What happens during the race?</h2>
          <p>
            Please visit the Race Info page for all details on what to expect on
            race day.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="faq6">Will the race be cancelled if it rains?</h2>
          <p>
            This event will occur rain or shine. We suggest ponchos and rain
            gear if it does happen to rain. All registration fees and donations
            are non-refundable in the event of rain.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="faq7">Do I need to register my child?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, if your child is participating in the 5K/10K races. There is no
            need to register children for the 1 Mile Fun Run.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="faq8">Can I bring my pet?</h2>
          <p>
            Pets are discouraged at the race. There are over 2000 people
            competing in the race and it is too crowded to accommodate pets.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="faq9">Where do I park?</h2>
          <p>
            The earlier you arrive at the race site, the easier parking will be!
            You may park on the streets as long as you are not blocking
            driveways or residential streets. We encourage you to carpool with
            your team or other participants if possible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="faq10">Can I collect sponsorship online?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. You can sign up at several web charity organizers and follow
            their easy step by step guide to create your own online fund-raising
            page. All money raised through your page will be automatically sent
            through to us and allocated to your record.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 id="faq11">How do I withdraw from the event?</h2>
          <p>
            The registration pack will include an official event magazine with
            withdrawal instructions. Complete the withdrawal form and send it to
            the race organizers along with the race gear and timing chip. A $10
            organizational fee will be charged to all withdrawals.
          </p>

          <h2 id="faq12">
            I am looking for accommodation for the event, where is best to stay?
          </h2>
